0x19 C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO ‚úèÔ∏è

    C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers concepts of Stacks, Queues, LIFO, FIFO implementation. This was a duo project with the awesome partner Karen Herrera

At the end of this project, We were able to solve these questions:

    What do LIFO and FIFO mean
    What is a stack, and when to use it
    What is a queue, and when to use it
    What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
    What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
    What is the proper way to use global variables

Tasks ‚úîÔ∏è
